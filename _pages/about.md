Welcome! I’m Xiran Li, a passionate food science researcher and independant software developer currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Food Science and a Master’s in Computer Science at UC Davis. My work is a unique blend of bioinformatics, food safety, and computational science, allowing me to tackle complex real-world challenges. I have a strong interest in backend and full-stack development.

I’ve built systems that improve everyday processes in our research labs, such as my lab inventory management system, which streamlined operations and communication for lab staff. I enjoy building tools and applications that not only improve my life but also the lives of people around me.

I’m constantly learning, pushing the boundaries of my knowledge, and embracing technical challenges in both computer science and bioinformatics. I hope to continue creating innovative solutions that combine my diverse skill set and interdisciplinary background.

Feel free to explore my projects, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you’d like to collaborate!
